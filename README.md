. INTRODUCTION
• Linear regression algorithm shows a linear relationship between a dependent (x) and
one or more independent (y) variables. Since linear regression shows the linear
relationship, which means it finds how the value of the dependent variable is changing
according to the value of the independent variable.
• It is a statistical method that is used for predictive analysis. Linear regression makes
predictions for continuous/real or numeric variables such as sales, salary, age, product
price, etc.
Area of application
• This model will help in predicting the best possible values for the given points to find
the best fit line, which will have minimum error.
• House price predictions are also beneficial for property investors to know the trend of
housing prices in a certain location.


Objectives
• To predict the price of house based on Regression techniques.
• The model aims to provide an accurate prediction, by finding the best fit line.

Algorithmic approach
Linear regression is a quiet and simple statistical regression method used for predictive
analysis and shows the relationship between the continuous variables. Linear regression
shows the linear relationship between the independent variable (Y-axis) and the dependent
variable (X-axis), consequently called linear regression.
Regression analysis is widely used for forecasting. Regression analysis is used to
understand which among the independent variables are related to the dependent variable,
and to explore the forms of these relationships. If more independent variables are added, it
is able to determine an estimating equation that describes the relationship with greater
accuracy. Multiple regressions look at each independent variable and test whether it
contributes significantly to the way the regression describes the data [3].
